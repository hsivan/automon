Latex source files of the paper [AutoMon: Automatic Distributed Monitoring for Arbitrary
Multivariate Functions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3514221.3517866?casa_token=n1jzfjzOu_wAAAAA:3bFuYHdf9wNOZnO-jHySzZOJm7DS3mP9vzmOrBzr8W9w3dSVixyr_vYvCDMHTeRmW6jPQpIH9cbH2dA).

These source files are used to verify reproducibility:<br />
The script [reproduce_experiments.py](../../reproduce_experiments.py) runs all the experiments and generates the paper's
figures from the experiment results.
Finally, it compiles the Latex source files with the newly generated figures, and the output could be compared
to the original paper to verify reproducibility.
